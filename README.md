### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam Clements - a Python developer and "DevOps" engineer. I've been open-sourcing as much as my work as possible since I was young. Most of the usable projects are small libaries and command line tools written in Python and Rust.

You can contact me by email at [sam@borntyping.co.uk](mailto:sam@borntyping.co.uk) or on Twitter at [@borntyping](https://twitter.com/borntyping).
